🪐 Node.js api created with docker and postgres that consumes swapi data

## Available Scripts 🏃🏻

This project runs with a postgres container, for now, we have only one script to run:

### `yarn dev` 
Runs the app in the development mode on http://localhost:3333

### Soon ⏱
We are implementing docker-compose to organize postgres container and node container together.
